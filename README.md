# mkz_mpc_path_follower

This is a project to use model predictive control (MPC) with the Lincoln MKZ DBW system developed by Dataspeed (found here: https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros/).

The Twist Controller from Dataspeed is modified to allow acceleration and steering angle command directly.

A MPC module is added, using a nonlinear kinematic bicycle model and IPOPT solver in Julia, to follow a path generated by a separate path planning module.
